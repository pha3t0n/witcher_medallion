Note, alternative hardware may be preferrable and create a smaller footprint to fit behind the medallion, so yymv, and do your own research. Specifically, the MCU could be smaller and the battery could be smaller - 150mAh was plenty for this project and could likely be reduced depending on the battery life you are looking to obtain.
